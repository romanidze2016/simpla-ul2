# simpla-ul

This is one of the most challenging projects I worked on at the university. Me and my other two group members were given a task by a start-up company called Simpla. Our task was to create three custom HTML elements from scratch: simpla-video, simpla-ul (unordered list) and simpla-ol (ordered list). My responsibilities were to develop the element simpla-ul as well as to fix all the bugs the elements had. The project was a good experience of working with people in the industry as well as a good incentive to learn new technologies like polymer and web components.

### Installation & usage

Install simpla-ul with Bower

```sh
$ bower install simpla-ul --save
```

Import it into the `<head>` of your page

```html
<link rel="import" href="/bower_components/simpla-ul/simpla-ul.html">
```

Then use simpla-ul in your project

```html
<simpla-ul></simpla-ul>
```

Note for cross-browser support you should also include the [Web Components Polyfill][webcomponents].
